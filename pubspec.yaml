# The following line prevents the package from being accidentally published to
# pub.dev using `flutter pub publish`. This is preferred for private packages.
publish_to: 'none' # Remove this line if you wish to publish to pub.dev

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number used as CFBundleVersion.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  # assets:
  #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: NotoSansBlack
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/NotoSansTC-Black.otf
    - family: NotoSansMedium
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/NotoSansTC-Medium.otf    
    - family: NotoSansBold
      fonts:      
        - asset: assets/NotoSansTC-Bold.otf
    - family: NotoSansRegular
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/NotoSansTC-Regular.otf
    - family: NotoSansLight
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/NotoSansTC-Light.otf        
    - family: NotoSansThin
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/NotoSansTC-Thin.otf

  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
